## Investment Calculations

The tool calculates fund growth using the following formula:
- Initial value = `Initial investment` Ã— (1 - `Sales load`)
- Annual growth = `Previous value` Ã— (1 + `Rate of return` - `Expense ratio`)
- Annual contribution = `Yearly contribution` Ã— (1 - `Sales load`)

This accounts for the impact of fees and loads on long-term investment performance.
